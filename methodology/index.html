                        <p>
                          To understand the nature of the demands for equity that have been made in recent history, a team of researchers qualitatively coded the demands from a set of documents promoting racial equity at UVA. This is intended to elevate the voices of the groups, activists, initiatives, and community organizers before us who have identified both inequities and recommended changes for decades rather than asking the same questions of the community to receive the same answers along with the accompanying frustrations. This conjures the idea of Sankofa, a Ghanaian word that translates to “go back and get it”, alluding to the belief that reflection on the past and the knowledge it holds must be honored and is necessary to build a better future.

                        <p>
                          These documents represent both historical and current documents from a variety of groups that have demanded change at UVA. It is not a full record of all documents, groups or demands and we invite the community to share additional documents we have missed so that they can be included in these voices. If there are additional documents you believe should be reviewed, please email us a link or a copy of the document at racialequity@virginia.edu. Initially documents were included based on their direct submission to University leadership over the years. In review of these sources we further included documents that were referenced in those originally submitted.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Before coding the full array of documents, the qualitative research team reviewed two of the more comprehensive documents to collectively develop an initial set of categories:
                          <ul>
                            <li>Diversity Resource Index (2017) -- A historical record of progress made pertaining to diversity, equity, and inclusion at UVA over the past several decades. A list of more than two hundred recommendations were compiled along with “actions taken” into a database and synthesized. This work serves as a model for methodology and guide for our current task.</li>
                            <li>Black Student Alliance Demands (2020) -- These demands capture a prioritization of requests made by the BSA since the 1980s that have not been adequately met by the University. The generational voices of these students are elevated in the current task.</li>
                          </ul>
                        </p>

                        <p> From this review, we developed a code list with definitions of each category of demands.</p>

                        <h1>CODING</h1>
                        <p>
                          The qualitative research team imported the collection of documents into Dedoose, a qualitative coding software system. Researchers used the defined coding list to read through each document, to tag statements that made recommendations, demands, or policy proposals, and to assign each identified statement to all of the demand categories to which it applied. That is, a single demand statement could touch on recommendations that speak to multiple categories.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                          Each historic document was read by at least two coders to validate the coding. Each week, the coding team met to discuss uncertain statements and evaluate code groupings and hierarchy. After all the documents were coded, the team met again to discuss the definitions of each code and establish a final hierarchy of categories.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                          In addition to the demand categories, researchers also recorded data about each document including the authors and what groups they represent, the date of publication, and to whom the document was submitted or addressed.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                          Simultaneously, a historical research team identified and recorded key events that define the context in which the demands were made, capturing additional documentation around those events. The team used report keywords (e.g. “Muddy Floor”, “Audacious Faith”) as search terms in local and national newspaper archives (e.g. Cavalier Daily, Daily Progress, Washington Post) and the University Library’s Virgo search catalog. The team highlighted specific institutional, local, or national events explicitly referenced in the reports as inspiring the report’s development or stemming from the report’s initiatives.

                        <h1>VISUALIZATION & ANALYSIS</h1>
                        <p>
                          The qualitative and contextual data were used to build the interactive timeline. The qualitative data also formed the basis of the analysis of demands over time in the stream graphs, of demands by speaker type, and of the content of the demand categories. In each of these analyses, we excluded the Diversity Resource Index document from 2017. As a compilation of past demands, the document contains every category at a higher frequency than any other single document, appearing as an outlier and skewing the results.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                          The stream graphs, a version of a stacked area bar graph, with the area between data/documents points smoothed via interpolation (in this case, a cardinal spline interpolation), represents the frequency with which different demand types are made across documents and time.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                          The circular barplot of speakers shows the frequency with which each author group made demands of a given type. The plots show the proportion of demands within a given theme made by a particular author group, with each demand category scaled to 1.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                          The circular barplot of keyness, or distinctive words within a demand category, presents the top ten distinctive words within each category relative to the words’ presence in these documents overall. Keyness was based on a chi-squared test comparing the frequency of each word within a category to the expected frequency, given no distinctiveness, as defined by the overall frequency in the full document set. The words with the highest chi-square values have the highest keyness. What is shown on the circular barplot, though, is the frequency of each keyword’s appearance within that theme, a more easily interpreted value.
