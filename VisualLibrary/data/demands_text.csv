The attraction of a ""critical mass"" of black faculty members--that is recruitment in sufficient numbers in all academic areas and on all levels to establish as a permanent integral feature of University life--will provide several major beneflts. First, it will expose all students to diverse perspectives in the classroom and provide a broadened educational experience. Second, it will signal the development of a more heterogeneous welcoming atmosphere at the Unersity that will in turn help attract and retain a more diverse student body at the undergraduate, graduate, and professional school levels, as well as a more diverse support staff.

In fact closely and logically related; the future of opportunities for minorities depends in large part upon the sensitivity and the values of whites who will continue to make up the majority of our society for the foreseeable future. Thus in some respects the desire to improve the educational experience for the present generation of white-Anglo students may really be the most substantial of all. Robert M: O'Neil Discriminating Against Discrimination (1975) . As discussed in previous sections of this report, over the years the University of has received numerous cogently argued reports prepared by well-intentioned, duly invested committees that have recommended greater University efforts to welcome black stUdents and faculty and to promote integration. After studying the record, the Task Force on Afro-Ameri can Affairs must sadly conclude that, despite the good will of many individuals, all too often the University's response to these recommendations has been hesitant, ineffective, and, at times, unconvincing. We believe that it is fair to characterize the University's posture over the last two decades toward promoting genuine integration--as opposed to legally mandated desegregation--as passive rather than active. One of the primary reasons that the results have been as they are is the fact that the University has neglected to establish an authoritative, ongoing mechanism to oversee integration efforts and to hold those responsible for progress accountable.",1987,1987,6,0,1987 an-audacious-faith.pdf,AN AUDACIOUS FAITH,Task Force on Afro-American Affairs,Faculty and Student Group,16,Committee members,Composed for UVA President and Board of Visitors,University Office,1,16 Committee members Composed for UVA President and Board of Visitors,#Data Collection And Transparency

Tutorial services of one sort or another are presently provided by various Schools and departments, by student honor societies and service groups, and by the Office of Afro-American Affairs and the Athletic Department. Still ether offices, such as the Counseling Center, offer important sess ions on academic skills development. These services, many of which have been developed on an ad hoc basis, have never been fully and continually inventoried, nor are they coordinated by a single, well-identified administrative unit. As a result, many students, faculty, and administrators are not well informed about the tutorial programs that now exist. Moreover, no formally sanctioned mechanism exists to evaluate the nature and quality of these dispersed programs, to assess particular students' needs, or to identify gaps and duplications in services.

Strategic Rationale/Program Descriptlon: The major function of the Learning Needs and Evaluation Center, which operates under the purview of the Vice President for Student Affairs, is to test students of all races who may have handicapping conditions or special learning needs and to make recommendations to the faculty as to what adjustments might be necessary to accommodate these Conditions and needs. Clearly the function should be regarded as an important element in the University's academic support program, and one that relates closely to the other academic support services that should fall under the supervision of the Provost (e.g., Transition Program, tutorial system). The Committee on Student Development Services in 1986 recommended the following: All special education programs. particularly the Learning Needs and Evaluation Center, should be better categorized, coordinated, communicated, and advertised. Each group of programs with similar academic purposes. such as remedial instruction. instruction for the handicapped or tutorial supplements to curricular programs. should be placed under the vice president for academic affairs (i.e., the Provost) who should postulate a University program which is well understood and taken advantage of by school constituencies.",1987,1987,11,1,1987 an-audacious-faith.pdf,AN AUDACIOUS FAITH,Task Force on Afro-American Affairs,Faculty and Student Group,16,Committee members,Composed for UVA President and Board of Visitors,University Office,1,16 Committee members Composed for UVA President and Board of Visitors,#Mentorship + Assistance + Training
